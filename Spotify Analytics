# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL.

#1. What are the top 10 songs filtered by popularity?

select artist_name, track_name, popularity
from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
order by popularity desc
limit 10;

#2. Which artist has the most songs and what is there danceability of each song?

select artist_name, track_name, danceability
from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
where artist_name = 'Olivia Rodrigo'
group by artist_name, track_name;

#3.  What artist released the longest song?

select artist_name, track_name, duration_ms
from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
order by duration_ms desc
limit 1;

#4. What is the average danceability by artist and track?

select artist_name, track_name, avg(danceability)
from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
group by artist_name, track_name;
