#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

select count(orderid)
from BIT_DB.JanSales
where length(orderid)=6
and orderid <> 'orderid';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
select count(orderid)
from BIT_DB.JanSales
where length(orderid)=6
and orderid <> 'orderid'
and product= 'iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
select distinct acctnum
from BIT_DB.FebSales
join BIT_DB.customers
on FebSales.orderID=customers.order_id
where length(orderID)=6
and orderID<> 'orderID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
select distinct product, price
from BIT_DB.JanSales
order by price asc
limit 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
select sum(quantity) * price as revenue, product
from BIT_DB.JanSales
group by product, price;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
select product, quantity, sum(quantity) * price as revenue
from BIT_DB.FebSales
where location= '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
group by product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
select count(distinct customers.acctnum), avg(quantity*price)
from BIT_DB.FebSales
left join BIT_DB.customers
on FebSales.orderID=customers.order_id
where FebSales.Quantity >2
and length(orderid)=6
